# Deep-learning-challenge
Module 21 Challenge
## Description:
With the help of machine learning and neural networks, we will use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. In this challenge, I was able to import the necessary csv file, preprocess the data, Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model. 
 ## Installations
 I used train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection, StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing, pandas and tensorflow.

 ## Other Instructions:
 There are two jupyter notebooks. Starter_Code notebook contians the initial model that I worked on and AlphabetCharity_Optimization contains two neural network models, modified from the initial model to optimize its work. The report can be found in a pdf file.

 ## Contributing
All the problems are solved with the help of the activities. Googled the method to export the model to HDF5 file.
